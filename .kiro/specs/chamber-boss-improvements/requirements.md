# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chamber Boss WordPress plugin currently has several issues that need to be addressed to improve functionality and user experience. The plugin manages chamber of commerce memberships with Stripe payment processing and business directory listings. Key problems include block editor issues with business listing categories, incomplete Stripe integration, and missing membership pricing configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chamber administrator, I want business listing categories to work properly in the editor, so that I can organize listings effectively in the directory. 

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates or edits a business listing THEN the system SHALL display business categories correctly in the editor interface
2. WHEN an administrator selects categories for a business listing THEN the system SHALL save and display those categories properly
3. WHEN a business listing is viewed on the frontend THEN the system SHALL display the assigned categories correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chamber administrator, I want to use the classic editor for business listings instead of the block editor, so that all business information fields are simple and easy to manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new business listing THEN the system SHALL use the classic editor interface
2. WHEN an administrator edits an existing business listing THEN the system SHALL use the classic editor interface
3. WHEN using the classic editor THEN the system SHALL display all business meta fields (phone, website, address, featured status) in an organized meta box
4. WHEN saving a business listing in classic editor THEN the system SHALL preserve all meta field data correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential chamber member, I want to sign up and pay for membership through Stripe, so that I can become an active member and create business listings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the membership signup form THEN the system SHALL create a Stripe checkout session with the configured membership price
2. WHEN a user completes Stripe payment THEN the system SHALL create a user account with chamber_member role
3. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL create an active membership record in the database
4. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL create a business listing for the new member
5. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
6. WHEN a user's payment is processed THEN the system SHALL send confirmation email to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chamber administrator, I want to configure membership pricing in the plugin settings, so that I can set and update the membership cost without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the plugin settings THEN the system SHALL display a membership pricing configuration section
2. WHEN an administrator enters a membership price THEN the system SHALL validate the input as a positive number
3. WHEN an administrator saves the membership price THEN the system SHALL store the value securely
4. WHEN the signup form is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the configured membership price to users
5. WHEN creating Stripe checkout sessions THEN the system SHALL use the configured membership price

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chamber administrator, I want to manage member accounts and business listings through the admin interface, so that I can add, edit, and remove users and their listings as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the member management page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all current members
2. WHEN an administrator clicks to edit a member THEN the system SHALL allow modification of member details and membership status
3. WHEN an administrator adds a new member manually THEN the system SHALL create both the user account and associated business listing
4. WHEN an administrator deletes a member THEN the system SHALL remove the user account and associated business listing
5. WHEN an administrator changes a member's status THEN the system SHALL update the membership record accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a chamber administrator, I want the Stripe webhook integration to work reliably, so that membership status updates automatically when payments are processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stripe sends a checkout.session.completed webhook THEN the system SHALL activate the user's membership
2. WHEN Stripe sends an invoice.payment_succeeded webhook THEN the system SHALL extend the user's membership period
3. WHEN Stripe sends an invoice.payment_failed webhook THEN the system SHALL notify the user and update membership status
4. WHEN processing webhooks THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook signature for security
5. IF webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error for administrator review
