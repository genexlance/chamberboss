# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the Chamber Boss plugin improvements to fix business listing category issues, implement classic editor support, complete Stripe integration, add membership pricing configuration, and enhance admin management capabilities. The solution maintains backward compatibility while improving user experience and administrative functionality.

## Architecture

### Current Architecture Analysis
The Chamber Boss plugin follows a monolithic WordPress plugin architecture with:
- Single main class `Chamber_Boss` handling all functionality
- Custom post type `business_listing` with taxonomy `business_category`
- Custom database table `cb_memberships` for membership tracking
- Stripe integration through webhook handler
- MailPoet integration for email list management

### Proposed Architecture Enhancements
- Maintain existing monolithic structure for simplicity
- Add membership pricing configuration to WordPress options
- Enhance Stripe integration with proper checkout flow
- Implement classic editor enforcement for business listings
- Improve category handling and display

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Business Listing Editor Enhancement

**Classic Editor Enforcement:**
- Disable Gutenberg block editor specifically for `business_listing` post type
- Use `use_block_editor_for_post_type` filter to force classic editor
- Maintain existing meta box structure for business details

**Category Display Fix:**
- Ensure taxonomy registration includes proper REST API support
- Add category meta box to classic editor interface
- Implement proper category saving and display logic

### 2. Membership Pricing Configuration

**Settings Integration:**
- Add new settings fields to existing settings page
- Store membership price in WordPress options table
- Implement price validation and sanitization
- Display pricing in signup form

**Settings Fields:**
```php
- cb_membership_price (decimal, default: 100.00)
- cb_membership_currency (string, default: 'usd')
- cb_membership_interval (string, default: 'year')
```

### 3. Stripe Integration Enhancement

**Checkout Flow:**
- Replace current basic signup with Stripe Checkout integration
- Create checkout session with configured pricing
- Handle success/cancel redirects
- Implement proper error handling

**Payment Processing:**
- Enhance webhook handler for reliable payment processing
- Add proper signature verification
- Implement membership activation logic
- Add payment confirmation emails

### 4. Admin Management Interface

**Member Management:**
- Enhance existing member management page
- Add edit/delete functionality for members
- Implement bulk actions for member management
- Add membership status indicators

**Business Listing Management:**
- Integrate business listing management with member management
- Allow admins to edit business listings from member interface
- Implement proper permission checks

## Data Models

### Enhanced Membership Model
```php
// Existing cb_memberships table structure maintained
// Additional meta fields stored in wp_options:
- cb_membership_price: decimal(10,2)
- cb_membership_currency: varchar(3)
- cb_membership_interval: varchar(20)
```

### Business Listing Meta Fields
```php
// Existing meta fields maintained:
- _business_phone: varchar(20)
- _business_website: varchar(255)
- _business_address: text
- _is_featured: boolean
```

### User Meta Extensions
```php
// Additional user meta for enhanced functionality:
- stripe_customer_id: varchar(255)
- membership_signup_date: datetime
- last_payment_date: datetime
```

## Error Handling

### Stripe Integration Errors
- Payment processing failures: Display user-friendly error messages
- Webhook processing errors: Log to WordPress error log
- API connection issues: Graceful degradation with admin notifications

### Form Validation Errors
- Membership signup form: Client-side and server-side validation
- Admin settings: Input sanitization and validation
- Business listing forms: Required field validation

### Database Operation Errors
- Membership creation failures: Rollback user creation
- Business listing creation failures: Notify admin
- Settings update failures: Display error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- Test membership pricing configuration functions
- Test Stripe checkout session creation
- Test webhook signature verification
- Test business listing category handling

### Integration Testing
- Test complete signup flow with Stripe
- Test webhook processing end-to-end
- Test admin member management operations
- Test classic editor functionality

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test signup process from user perspective
- Test admin management workflows
- Test business listing creation and editing
- Test category assignment and display

### Security Testing
- Test webhook signature verification
- Test input sanitization and validation
- Test permission checks for admin functions
- Test secure storage of sensitive data

## Implementation Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing database schema
- Preserve existing shortcode functionality
- Keep existing user roles and capabilities
- Maintain existing MailPoet integration

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize database queries in directory display
- Implement proper caching for settings
- Optimize Stripe API calls
- Use WordPress transients for temporary data

### Security Measures

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use WordPress security functions
- Secure Stripe API key storage

### Scalability Considerations
- Design for multiple membership tiers (future enhancement)
- Structure for additional payment methods
- Plan for increased member volume
- Consider caching strategies for directory

## Migration Strategy

- Migrate existing Stripe configuration
- Preserve existing member data
- Update database schema if needed

### User Experience Transition
- Gradual rollout of classic editor
- Maintain existing shortcode functionality
- Preserve existing member accounts
- Ensure seamless payment processing

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging Strategy
- Log Stripe webhook events
- Log payment processing results
- Log membership status changes
- Log admin actions for audit trail

### Health Checks
- Monitor Stripe API connectivity
- Check webhook endpoint accessibility
- Validate membership data integrity
- Monitor payment processing success rates
