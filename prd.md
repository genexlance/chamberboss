Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Overview

Product Name


Chamber Membership Manager Plugin

Product Description


This is a WordPress plugin designed for Chambers of Commerce to manage memberships, process payments via Stripe, and maintain a business directory. Members can create and manage their own business listings, which are featured in a searchable directory. The plugin emphasizes ease of use, security, and integration with WordPress's native features.

The plugin will be hosted and available for download on a dedicated Netlify site, which serves as a showcase (e.g., including demos, documentation, pricing, and download links). The Netlify site will be a simple static site built with tools like HTML/CSS/JS or a framework like Gatsby/Hugo for fast performance.

4. Features and Functional Requirements

Core Features

1. 


Membership Management


	- User roles: Integrate with WordPress user system (e.g., create custom roles like "Chamber Member").
	- Signup flow: New users register via a form, pay via Stripe, and get auto-approved as members upon successful payment.
	- Membership tiers: Basic (free trial/listing only) and Premium (paid, with featured listings or extras). Configurable in plugin settings.
	- Renewal reminders: Email notifications (using WordPress mail) for expiring memberships.
2. 
Business Listings


	- Creation/Editing: Logged-in members can create listings via a frontend form or WordPress dashboard. Fields include: Business name, description, address, phone, website, categories (e.g., retail, services), images/logo, and custom fields (e.g., hours of operation).
	- Approval Workflow: Admins review and approve listings before they go live (toggleable in settings).
	- Listing Management: Members can edit/delete their own listings; admins can manage all.
3. 
Business Directory


	- Public-facing page/shortcode: A searchable directory (e.g., [chamber-directory]) displaying all approved listings.
	- Search/Filter: By category, location (integrate with Google Maps API if premium), keywords.
	- Display: Grid/list view with pagination, sorting (e.g., by name or date added).
	- SEO Optimization: Use WordPress custom post types (CPT) for listings to ensure search engine friendliness.
4. 
Stripe Integration


	- Payment Processing: Handle one-time or recurring memberships via Stripe Checkout or Elements.
	- Secure API Key Storage: Use WordPress options API (e.g., update_option()) with encryption (via wp_encrypt() if available, or a secure vault like WordPress's built-in secrets). Provide admin settings page for entering Publishable Key and Secret Key.
	- Webhooks: Handle Stripe events (e.g., payment succeeded → grant membership; payment failed → notify user).
	- Compliance: Ensure PCI compliance by not storing card details; use Stripe's tokenization.
5. 
MailPoet Integration


	- Newsletter Lists: Automatically manage two separate lists in MailPoet—one for members (e.g., "Chamber Members Newsletter") and one for non-members (e.g., "General Subscribers").
	- Subscription Flow:
		- Members: Upon successful membership signup or renewal (via Stripe webhook), auto-subscribe the user to the members' list (with opt-in confirmation if required by law, e.g., GDPR).
		- Non-Members: Provide an opt-in form (e.g., shortcode [chamber-newsletter-optin]) on the directory or other pages for visitors to subscribe to the non-members' list.
	- Unsubscription/Removal: Auto-remove from lists on membership expiration or manual unsubscribe (sync with MailPoet hooks).
	- Admin Controls: Settings page to select/configure MailPoet lists, enable/disable auto-subscription, and customize welcome emails.
	- Error Handling: If MailPoet is not installed/activated, display a admin notice and disable related features gracefully.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Load times < 2 seconds for directory pages; support up to 1,000 listings without slowdown.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliant (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation).
- Internationalization: Support for translations (e.g., via .pot files).
- Mobile Responsiveness: Fully responsive for all frontend elements.

5. Technical Requirements

Plugin Architecture

- WordPress Compatibility: Built as a standard plugin (ZIP file installable via WordPress dashboard).
- Dependencies:
	- PHP 8.0+.
	- Composer for managing libraries (e.g., Stripe PHP SDK v10+ as of 2025).
	- Required: MailPoet plugin (latest version as of 2025) for newsletter integration.
	- Optional: Google Maps API for location features.
- Database: Use WordPress custom post types (CPT) for listings and custom tables for membership data (to avoid bloating wp_posts).
- Security:
	- Sanitize all inputs (e.g., sanitize_text_field()).
	- Use nonces for forms.
	- Store Stripe keys encrypted; provide a "Test Mode" toggle for development.
- Error Handling: Graceful failures (e.g., "Payment failed—please try again") with logging to WordPress debug log.

Netlify Showcase Site

- Purpose: Static site to promote the plugin, with sections for: Home (overview), Features, Demo (embedded WordPress demo or screenshots), Pricing, Download (ZIP file link), Documentation (setup guide, FAQs), Contact/Support.
- Tech Stack: Netlify-hosted (free tier), built with HTML/CSS/JS or static site generator (e.g., Eleventy or Astro for simplicity).
- Download Mechanism: Secure download link (e.g., via Netlify Functions for gated access if premium). Track downloads with analytics (e.g., Google Analytics).
- Deployment: Auto-deploy from GitHub repo; include a simple form for user feedback.

6. Assumptions and Dependencies

- Assumptions:
	- Users have a Stripe account and basic WordPress knowledge.
	- No custom themes required; plugin styles use WordPress enqueues.
	- Multi-site compatible.
- Dependencies:
	- External APIs: Stripe (requires account), optional Google Maps.
	- Internal: MailPoet plugin must be installed and configured for newsletter features.
	- Risks: Stripe API changes (mitigate by using official SDK); WordPress updates (test compatibility); MailPoet API changes (use official hooks).
- Out of Scope:
	- Advanced analytics (e.g., member engagement tracking).
	- Mobile app integration.
