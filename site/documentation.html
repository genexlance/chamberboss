            <h2>General Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Can we customize the membership price?</h3>
            <p>Yes. In the Chamberboss settings, you can set the annual membership price to any amount you choose. You can also select your preferred currency.</p>

            <h3>How are membership renewals handled?</h3>
            <p>The plugin automatically sends a renewal reminder email to members before their subscription expires. You can customize the content of this email and how many days in advance it's sent from the settings page.</p>

            <h3>Can we manually add or edit members?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. From the "Members" page in the WordPress admin, you can add new members manually or edit the details of existing members, including their subscription status and expiration date.</p>

        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Business Directory</h2>

            <h3>Do we have to approve new business listings?</h3>
            <p>Yes. When a member submits a new business listing, it is set to "Pending" by default. A chamber administrator must review and approve the listing before it appears in the public directory. This gives you full control over the content.</p>

            <h3>Can we feature certain business listings?</h3>
            <p>Yes. You can mark any listing as "Featured" from the listing management page. This allows you to highlight specific members in your directory, which can be offered as a premium benefit.</p>

            <h3>How do we organize the business directory?</h3>
            <p>You can create custom categories (e.g., "Restaurants," "Retail," "Professional Services") from the "Categories" page. Members can then select a category when submitting their listing, making the directory easy for visitors to navigate.</p>

        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Payments & Integration</h2>

            <h3>What payment gateways are supported?</h3>
            <p>Chamberboss integrates exclusively with Stripe, a secure and widely trusted payment processor. This allows you to accept credit card payments for memberships safely and efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Is it possible to test the payment system?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The plugin has a "Test Mode" for Stripe. This allows you to simulate transactions and ensure everything is working correctly without processing real payments. We provide detailed instructions for this in our <a href="installation.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>Does this plugin work with other WordPress plugins?</h3>
            <p>Chamberboss is built to standard WordPress coding practices to ensure compatibility. It also includes a direct integration for the popular MailPoet plugin, allowing you to automatically manage your member mailing lists.</p>

            <h2>Support & Troubleshooting</h2>

            <h3>What if we need help setting up the plugin?</h3>

            <h3>What are the technical requirements?</h3>
